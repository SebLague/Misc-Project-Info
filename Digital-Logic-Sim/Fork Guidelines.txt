If you've created a fork of the Digital Logic Sim project, and plan on distributing it, please follow these guidelines.

1. In the project settings, change the Company Name to something other than "SebastianLague".
2. Do not write save files into the same location as the official version (changing the company name will do this by default).
3. The project must be free to download (accepting donations is fine), and the source code must be available.
4. There should be some indication in the main menu that it's not the official version.

Thank you!
